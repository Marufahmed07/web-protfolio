                <h3> World-class professional web developer</h3>
                <p>This is important to ask, because so many people around the world are web developers, but how many of them are successful at it?

                My goal for this article is to equip you with the mindset, knowledge and skills to stand out from the crowd and make a success of your web development career — whether that’s at a company or freelancing for yourself.
                
                This article is intended for aspiring web developers and web developers who are struggling to break through the “barrier of mediocrity.”</p>
